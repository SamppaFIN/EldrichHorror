## 📋 Issues Reported

### 1. ✅ Aurora Encounter - Missing Chat Dialog
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Original Issue**:
> "the mobile user test S23U was success, got aurora to bring out the notification that it worked.. please bring out the legacy chat dialog in this encounter. This encounter added discovered number by +1 for that :)"

**What Worked**:
- ✅ Notification showed
- ✅ Discovery count incremented (+1)

**What Was Missing**:
- ❌ Legacy chat dialog didn't appear

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Created new `npc-chat-modal` in HTML with beautiful glass-morphism design
- ✅ Added comprehensive CSS styling for NPC portraits, dialogs, and rewards
- ✅ Implemented `showNPCDialog()` method in main.js
- ✅ Updated `interactWithAurora()` to show chat dialog with:
  - Aurora's portrait (animated SVG)
  - Multi-paragraph dialog text
  - Visual reward display (+25 XP, Lore Unlocked, +1 Discovery)
  - Continue button to close
  - Proper cleanup after dialog closes

**Files Modified**:
- `game/index.html` - Added NPC chat modal structure

### 2. ✅ Item Pickup - Incomplete Feedback
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Original Issue**:
> "The items pickup was kind of successfull, the item was cleared, but no sound, no notification.. the discovered peaces was not updated"

**What Worked**:
- ✅ Item cleared/removed from map

**What Was Missing**:
- ❌ No sound effect
- ❌ No notification
- ❌ Discovery count not updating

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Sound Effect**: Moved audio playback to FIRST in collection sequence for immediate feedback
- ✅ **Notification**: Ensured notification shows BEFORE marker removal (for visibility)
- ✅ **Discovery Count**: Added explicit logging and verification that `incrementDiscoveryCount()` is called
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout collection process to debug issues:
  - `🔊 Playing collection sound`
  - `📊 Discovery count incremented`
  - `📢 Notification shown`
  - `🗺️ Marker removed from map`
  - `✅ Discovery collected successfully`

**Files Modified**:
- `game/js/DiscoverySystem.js` - Enhanced `collectDiscovery()` method with:
  - Better error handling for audio
  - Explicit logging for debugging
  - Reordered operations for better UX (sound → notification → removal)
