## 🎮 How It Works

### GPS Simulation Algorithm
```
1. Start at position (lat, lng)
2. Choose random direction (0-360°)
3. Every second:
   - Move walkingSpeed meters in current direction
   - Check for pattern changes (stop, turn, curve)
   - Add GPS noise (±7m accuracy simulation)
   - Dispatch position update event
4. Game systems receive updates as if from real GPS
```

### Offline Gameplay
```
1. Enable testingMode in config
2. GPS simulator starts automatically
3. Discoveries spawn around player
4. Walk (auto or manual) to collect
5. All game mechanics work normally
6. Only map tiles require internet (for now)
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
```javascript
// 1. Open browser console
GameConfig.testingMode = true;
GameConfig.geolocation.simulator.enabled = true;
location.reload();

// 2. Testing panel appears in bottom-right
// 3. Click "Start Auto-Walk"
// 4. Watch player move and discoveries spawn
// 5. Walk within 15m of discoveries to collect
```

### Desktop Testing
```bash
# 1. Edit config.js
offlineMode: true
testingMode: true

# 2. Start game
# 3. Use direction pad to walk manually
# 4. Or use auto-walk for hands-free testing
```

### Mobile Testing
```
1. Open game on mobile
2. Enable testing mode
3. Testing panel is touch-friendly
4. Works with or without real GPS
5. Can mix simulated + real GPS
```
