## 🐛 Critical Issues Found

### 1. Discovery Proximity Not Triggering 🔴 CRITICAL

**Ticket**: `BRDC-DISCOVERY-PROXIMITY-007`

**Problem**:
```
"I was at correct gps position on the map, accuracy 7m
the discoveries didnt trigger"
```

**Impact**: Core gameplay mechanic broken on mobile

**Root Causes (Hypothesis)**:
1. Collection range too small (10m vs 7m GPS accuracy)
2. GPS update frequency insufficient
3. Distance calculation issues
4. Event listeners not firing properly

**Proposed Solutions**:
1. ✅ Add **visual proximity indicators**:
   - 🔴 Red glow: Within 100m
   - 🟡 Yellow glow: Within 20m
   - 🟢 Green glow: Within 5m
   - ⭐ Star effect: Within 1m (ready to collect)
2. ✅ Increase collection range to 15m
3. ✅ Add debug logging for mobile
4. ✅ Add manual "Check Proximity" button
5. ✅ Add "Reshuffle Discoveries" button

**Estimated Fix Time**: 4-6 hours

---

### 2. Step Counter Not Working 🟡 HIGH

**Ticket**: `BRDC-STEP-COUNTER-008`

**Problem**:
```
"The stepcounter did not work"
```

**User Request**:
```
"make me a way to toggle between simulation (+2 per second), 
Device and Experimental mode (Gyroscope + distance calculated 
between 2 last known positions and a timestamp)"
```

**Current State**: No step counting implemented

**Required Implementation**:

#### Mode 1: Simulation 🎮
- Auto-increment +2 steps/second
- For desktop/laptop testing
- No sensors required

#### Mode 2: Device 📱
- Use native pedometer if available
- Fall back to GPS-based estimation
- Standard mobile implementation

#### Mode 3: Experimental 🧪
- Gyroscope + accelerometer detection
- GPS position delta calculation
- Timestamp-based movement tracking
- Advanced hybrid algorithm

**Estimated Implementation Time**: 6-8 hours

## 🌟 New Feature Request

### 3. Eldritch Encounter System 🟣 EPIC

**Ticket**: `BRDC-ELDRITCH-ENCOUNTER-009`

**User Request**:
```
"I want some scary thing on the screen who is slowly approaching 
the player position, when it is within 1000m 100m 10m make a notice.. 
Make that encounter Heavy"
```

**Design Concept**: "The Watcher"

**Mechanics**:
- Spawns 1000-2000m from player
- Approaches slowly (6m/minute)
- Escalating warnings at:
  - **1000m**: "You feel watched..."
  - **100m**: "The air grows cold..."
  - **10m**: "IT IS HERE..."
  - **0m**: Full encounter modal
- Heavy horror atmosphere
- Screen effects (darkness, distortion, shaking)
- Choice-based resolution
- High-risk, high-reward outcomes

**Visual**:
- Shadowy entity with tentacles
- Grows larger/more detailed as it approaches
- Void-black aura
- Distortion effects

**Audio** (optional):
- Ambient dread sounds
- Heartbeat at 100m
- Terror sounds at 10m

**Estimated Implementation Time**: 12-16 hours

## 🎯 Priority Action Items

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Fix proximity detection** - BRDC-DISCOVERY-PROXIMITY-007
   - Add visual indicators
   - Increase collection range
   - Add manual check button
   - Implement reshuffle feature

### High Priority
2. **Implement step counter** - BRDC-STEP-COUNTER-008
   - Create StepCounterManager
   - Implement 3 modes
   - Add mode selector UI
   - Test on device

### Epic Feature
3. **Eldritch Encounter** - BRDC-ELDRITCH-ENCOUNTER-009

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Went Right
- ✅ Visual design translates perfectly to mobile
- ✅ GPS integration works flawlessly
- ✅ Performance is excellent
- ✅ No crashes or stability issues

### What Needs Improvement
- ❌ Proximity detection fails on mobile (GPS accuracy + update frequency)
- ❌ Step counter not implemented
- ⚠️ Need more mobile-specific testing
- ⚠️ Need manual controls for testing

### Design Insights
- **GPS accuracy matters**: 7m accuracy means ±7m uncertainty
- **Visual feedback crucial**: User can't tell if system is working
- **Mobile sensors different**: Need device-specific implementations
- **Testing tools needed**: Manual buttons for debugging
