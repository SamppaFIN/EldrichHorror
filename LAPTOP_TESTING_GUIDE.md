# 💻 Laptop Testing Guide - Discovery System
*Quick testing without GPS movement*

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Refresh** the page (Ctrl+R or F5)
2. Open **Browser Console** (F12)
3. Wait for map to load

---

## ✅ Step 1: Verify Spawning

### Look for this in console:
```
[DiscoverySystem] Spawning 7 discoveries...
[MapManager] Discovery marker added: discovery_xxx
[MapManager] Discovery marker added: discovery_yyy
... (should see 5-10 of these)
```

### Visual Check:
- Count the markers on the map
- Should see 5-10 colored markers (not the player marker)
- Each marker should have an icon (✨, 🌟, 🔮, 💫)

**✅ PASS if**: 5-10 markers visible  
**❌ FAIL if**: Only 1 marker or no markers

---

## 🧪 Step 2: List All Discoveries

### Type in console:
```javascript
game.systems.discovery.listDiscoveries()
```

### Expected Output:
```
📍 Active Discoveries (7):

1. ✨ Cosmic Fragment (common)
   Position: 61.469491, 23.730586
   XP Reward: 50

2. 🌟 Sacred Sigil (uncommon)
   Position: 61.470123, 23.731456
   XP Reward: 100

... (5-10 total)

💡 To collect nearest: game.systems.discovery.testCollectNearest()
```

**✅ PASS if**: Lists 5-10 discoveries with positions and XP

---

## 🎁 Step 3: Test Manual Collection

### Type in console:
```javascript
game.systems.discovery.testCollectNearest()
```

### What Should Happen:
1. **Console**: `[DiscoverySystem] 🧪 TEST: Force collecting Cosmic Fragment`
2. **Map**: One marker disappears
3. **Notification**: Toast appears top-right saying "✨ Discovery found!"
4. **XP**: Player XP increases (check top-left HUD)

### Verify XP Increase:
```javascript
// Check current XP before collecting:
game.systems.consciousness.state.xp

// Collect discovery
game.systems.discovery.testCollectNearest()

// Check XP again (should be +50, +100, +150, or +200 higher)
game.systems.consciousness.state.xp
```

**✅ PASS if**: 
- Marker disappears
- Notification appears
- XP increases
- Can collect multiple times

---

## 🔄 Step 4: Collect Multiple Discoveries

### Repeat collection:
```javascript
game.systems.discovery.testCollectNearest()
// Wait for notification to disappear (3 seconds)

game.systems.discovery.testCollectNearest()
// Repeat until all discoveries collected
```

### What to Watch:
- Each collection removes a marker
- Each shows a notification
- XP keeps increasing
- Notifications don't overlap (queue system)

**✅ PASS if**: Can collect all 5-10 discoveries successfully

---

## 📊 Step 5: Check Progress

### View collected count:
```javascript
game.systems.discovery.getDiscoveryCount()
// Should return number of discoveries you collected
```

### View game state:
```javascript
game.systems.gameState.state.player.totalDiscoveries
// Should match collected count
```

### Check if saved:
```javascript
// Refresh page (F5)
// Then check again:
game.systems.gameState.state.player.totalDiscoveries
// Should persist after refresh
```

**✅ PASS if**: Count persists after page refresh

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No discoveries spawned?
```javascript
// Check if system initialized:
game.systems.discovery
// Should return DiscoverySystem object

// Check if position available:
game.systems.geolocation.getPosition()
// Should return { lat: ..., lng: ... }

// Manually spawn discoveries:
const pos = game.systems.geolocation.getPosition();
if (pos) game.systems.discovery.spawnDiscoveries(pos);
```

### Notification not showing?
```javascript
// Test notification system:
game.systems.notifications.show('Test!', 'success', 3000)
// Should show notification top-right
```

### Marker not disappearing?
```javascript
// Check active discoveries:
game.systems.discovery.activeDiscoveries.size
// Should decrease after collection

// Check map markers:
game.systems.map.markers.size
// Should also decrease
```

## 🎯 Expected Results Summary

| Test | Expected | Command |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Spawning** | 5-10 markers on map | Visual check |
| **List** | Shows all discoveries | `listDiscoveries()` |
| **Collect** | Marker disappears | `testCollectNearest()` |
| **Notification** | Toast appears | (automatic) |
| **XP Reward** | XP increases | Check HUD or console |
| **Progress** | Count increments | `getDiscoveryCount()` |
| **Persistence** | Survives refresh | Refresh + check count |

## 🎮 Real GPS Testing (Mobile/Outdoor)

Once laptop testing passes, test with real GPS movement:

1. Open game on mobile device
2. Grant location permissions
3. Walk towards a discovery marker
4. Watch for auto-collection when within 10m
5. Verify all features work in real environment

---

**Test Status**: ⏳ **Awaiting User Verification**

Report results back and we'll fix any remaining issues! 🌸
