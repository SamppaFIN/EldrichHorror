## 🔧 Debugging Tips

### View Discovery System State
```javascript
// In browser console:
game.systems.discovery.activeDiscoveries  // See all active discoveries
game.systems.discovery.collectionRange    // Collection radius (10m)
game.systems.gameState.state.player.totalDiscoveries  // Total collected
```

### Manually Trigger Collection (for testing)
```javascript
// Get first active discovery
const discovery = Array.from(game.systems.discovery.activeDiscoveries.values())[0];
// Force collect it
game.systems.discovery.collectDiscovery(discovery);
```

### Check Notification System
```javascript
game.systems.notifications.show('Test notification!', 'success', 5000);
```

### Simulate GPS Position
```javascript
game.systems.geolocation.simulatePosition(61.4695, 23.7306); // Your coordinates
```
